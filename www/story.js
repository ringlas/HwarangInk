The enormous marketplace was crowded with people from all corners of the Goryeo Kingdom. The merchants were yelling and praising their goods, repeating the same selling phrases like mantras. With deep bows, they invited upper-class passers-by to feel their smooth soft linen or try on an exquisite jewel.","\n","^The crowd was as diverse as the swarm of smells wafting through the marketplace. The wind carried whiffs of fish mixed with the hot-and-sour scent of different sorts of kimchi. The smell of aromatic herbs, candied fruit and fragrance oils merged with the stench of horse and human sweat, manure and rotting garbage. This overwhelming bouquet could make anyone wish for a heavily perfumed handkerchief or at least a benevolent breeze. The cacophony of sounds, screams, clanking, clattering, babbling of water, rattling of carriages, wailing of aeolipiles, screeching of mechanical tools and the monotonous murmur of hundreds of voices all formed a constant deep rumble that could easily induce an avalanche down the slopes of the Azure Mountain that loomed over the city.","\n","^Somewhere among the throng of people, maddening sounds and scents, a kwangde with clothes made of patched rags was trying to earn his living.","\n","^\"Heheheeeii! Gather around! Young and old, rich and poor, honest and not so honest, come and listen to stories that no one else can tell and act out better than the famous Soo Yang – the best kwangde ever to walk the lands of our beloved kingdom! Heheheeeei!\"","\n","^Some passers-by looked at him with a mix of wonder and annoyance. \"This won’t do,\" he thought to himself and started anew:","\n","^\"Hohohoooii! Come one come all and listen to stories worthy of kings and queens, scholars and chroniclers. Tales of bravery and foolishness, love and betrayal, magic and heroes who are long gone but whose glory remains!\"","\n","^A small group of people began to gather around him.","\n","^\"Hohoheeeei! Don’t be shy and have no fear! Come closer and I will tell you the story of the brave kisaeng Min Yong and how she quenched the lust of the naughty Magistrate Mu Gwa! Come and hear the tale of how a brave villager outsmarted the greedy tax-collector Bu Dang!\"","\n","^People started losing interest once again and directed their attention to the colorful market goods. \"Come then and listen to the story of the hero Kwang Gi Ri and the river dragon!\"","\n","^\"We know these stories, kwangde! Don’t waste our time if that’s all you’ve got!\" A mocking yell came from the crowd.","\n","^\"What do I hear?\" the kwangde laughed. \"Someone dares challenge the great Soo Yang! Aigoo! Preposterous! Very well then, cynics! Come closer and I will tell you the story of the hwarang knight Kim Gee Soo and the kumiho!\" There was a melodramatic pause followed by gasps and excited shouts.","\n","^\"This tale is very old – from the time of the glorious kingdom of Silla; when the brave hwarang warriors – the flower knights – were numerous and respected, and every boy dreamed of becoming one and serving his king, his country and the truth. This story takes place in a time when shamans and magicians roamed our lands, evil spirits did not fear daylight, and demons walked among us in human form. A time when the earth would tremble as the gods themselves descended from the sky, the good buddhas protected the pure-hearted, the monks’ faith was still strong and true, and the heroes from the legends walked among ordinary folk.\"","\n","^The crowd grew visibly and more people were coming, their curiosity tickled by the kwangde’s words.","\n","^\"There once lived the brave hwarang Kim Gee Soo. His feats were many and his heroic deeds – beyond count. At that time, he was still young but his glory had spread far and wide. He was proud and handsome like a cold mountain morning and many maidens sighed and pined after him. His smile could melt ice and tame a wild beast. Eagle’s Charm they called him. Rumor had it that he was the illegitimate son of the old king and his favorite kisaeng – one of the king’s concubines. Thence Kim Gee Soo got his looks.","\n","^When Kim Gee Soo was born, his mother was afraid that the jealous queen might try to kill him, so she started putting small drops of different types of poison in his milk to build up his resistance. They called him the Snake’s Brother.","\n","^The kisaeng also had spiritual abilities – her grandmother was a renowned shaman and had taught her everything she could before Kim Gee Soo’s mother became a concubine. Whatever the kisaeng remembered, she passed on to her son. That is why Kim Gee Soo was also called the Shaman Knight.","\n","^Nothing could throw him off balance or break his concentration – no emotion, rage, pain or even a maiden’s smile. He was known as the Unyielding, and had the by-name of Darling of Fortune for his great luck, which saved him from many a hopeless situation.","\n","^He could catch an arrow mid-flight or a moving blade between his palms – the Lightning’s Shadow they called him. The hwarang was a master of archery, and no one in the whole kingdom could best him at it. He could shoot off the wings of a mosquito from a hundred feet away. For his mastery, he was known as Death from the Sky. But he was just as skilled with a sword – Blade Dancer they called him, as he could overcome four adversaries with just three strikes.","\n","^One day the son of a renowned magistrate heard stories of a fair maiden in a far-away village whose beauty was praised by the kwangdes. He fell in love with her only from the tales that people told about her. He wished, dreamed, longed for her and could catch no sleep. He wanted her to be his wife. Unfortunately, it was rumored that the maiden was cursed. Every wooer that would come to her father’s house to ask for her hand would die the next morning. This did not bother the magistrate’s son – he was languishing with love. He did not eat a grain of rice or drink a drop of water. He only drank soju from dusk till dawn and from dawn till dusk. The poor man’s father saw his son withering day after day, so he decided to seek help. In the past, the magistrate had done Kim Gee Soo a great favor by disproving a jealous kisaeng’s false claims. And so, he went to the brave hwarang asking for help – to find out if there truly was a curse upon the fair maiden and if there was one, to find its source and destroy it.","\n","^Gee Soo could not refuse as he was in the magistrate’s debt, and prepared to leave for the village of the cursed maiden.\"","\n","ev","str","^Tap here to create your character.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"character_creation"},"end",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"the_end":[{"#":"CLASS: end"},"^THE END","\n","^<h2>Credits:</h2>","\n","^<i>Author:</i>","\n","^Leidrin Sweever","\n","^<i>Art:</i>","\n","^Chywon Kim","\n","^Andrei Pervukhin","\n","^Björn Wirtz","\n","^Andrée Wallin","\n","^Tamer Karatas","\n","^<i>Made with Ink by Inkle</i>","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"game_over":[{"#":"99"},"^Seconds later, Hyo Won Jin barged into the room, and upon seeing the dead creature he fainted.

My lovely daughter, my dearest wife, will you ever forgive me?\"","\n","^After he recovered, he gathered the men from the village and found the cave with Sa Gwa’s remains. They searched the whole village and the outskirts for the old Gunn –but the nine-tailed fox had vanished.","\n","^Despite the victory, Gee Soo was not in a mood to celebrate, and neither were the shocked villagers.","\n","^Early in the morning, the hwarang began his trip back to the capital to report to the magistrate about what had happened, and that unfortunately his son would have to marry someone else.","\n","^\"And so, the brave hwarang Kim Gee Soo saved Yo Soo from the kumiho and returned to the capital as a hero. The villagers entombed the dead kumiho in the cave where its mother had hidden Sa Gwa’s body and from that day on the village was also known as Fox Den.\"","\n","^Some people in the crowd gasped in surprise, as this was the name of an actual village that was just a five days’ trip from So Wul.","\n","^\"Meanwhile, a hideous old woman was limping on the road to the capital. Damn you, hwarang, she kept cursing. Damn you! You took my daughter away – my most precious thing! Damn you to hell! Now I'll take away what you hold dearest to your heart – your honor!\"","\n","^The crowd held its breath in anticipation.","\n","^\"But that’s another story for another time,\" said the kwangde to the crowd’s disappointment.","\n","^\"But if you enjoyed this story – show me your gratitude and tomorrow I'll be back to tell you how the old kumiho took the shape of the Queen of Silla, killed the king and brought the country to shambles.

It was summer – the season where the weather could quickly turn from scorching sun to heavy showers, and the nature around him was lush and green. The air was muggy from the last rain and heavy with the fragrance of flowers and the odor of rotting vegetation.","\n","^The road was leading to the village of Yo Soo where the cursed maiden lived. The hwarang sighed and once again replayed in his mind the conversation with Magistrate Kang who had sent him on this fool’s errand.","\n","^\"Help your old friend, Gee Soo! My son is wasting away day after day and is beginning to look and act like a ghost!\" the magistrate said but meanwhile he was thinking, \"The damned ne’er-do-well is drunk day and night and brings great shame to my family! I will lose my job and my reputation because of this sluggard!\"","\n","^\"I would very much like to help you, Magistrate Kang...,\" Gee Soo started his excuse but was immediately interrupted.","\n","^\"And you will! You do remember last year when you were falsely accused of dishonoring Magistrate Lee’s daughter. It was I who helped justice triumph! Do I ask too much in return?\"","\n","^To that, Kim Gee Soo replied:","\n","^\"No, honorable and just magistrate!\" He bowed and added through his teeth, \"It would be a great honor to help your respectable heir!\" and thought to himself, \"Whose reputation is legendary in the capital’s brothels, or so I hear.\"","\n","^\"Besides, after you perform this noble and heroic deed, generations of kwangdes will praise your glory,\" said the magistrate putting much effort in hiding his smile of relief.","\n","^\"As if these damned shrill, garish jesters don’t already tell all sorts of cock-and-bull stories about me!\" thought Gee Soo, bowing even lower to hide his infuriated face.","\n","^And so, slowly but surely he was approaching his final destination in the hopes to find out why all of the cursed maiden’s suitors were found dead. Gee Soo had to lift the curse so that the magistrate’s son could ask her hand and finally stop consuming all of the capital’s liquor and tarnishing his fathers’ reputation. The hwarang had no idea how but he had to do his best. He was going to be mocked by his fellow hwarangs so the least he could do was try to succeed in this embarrassing task. The mood overwhelming him was as dark as the landscape was beautiful.

Two poorly crafted bows readied with arrows were pointed at Kim Gee Soo. The men were trying very hard to look scary and they were obviously taking themselves seriously. Kim Gee Soo did not want to disparage their hard-trained menacing poses, so he stifled his laughter behind his hand and stood still. The men took his gesture as a sign of fear and started yelling unintelligibly to intimidate him further. The hwarang had to use both his hands now to stop himself from bursting out. One of the riffraff, probably their leader, approached Kim Gee Soo and barked:","\n","^\"Come on rich boy, hand over your money and weapons, if you want to live!\"","\n","^The others drew closer forming a circle around the hwarang. Apparently, he was ambushed by a bunch of bandits. Kim Gee Soo spread his arms in a friendly gesture.","\n","^\"OK, boys, about the money – it’s not much but you can have it.\"","\n","^\"Give us your weapon first!\" snapped the leader.","\n","^\"All right, all right! Everybody just stay calm!\"","\n","^Hwarang drew his sword and threw it on the ground. The bandit picked it up. In the meantime, Gee Soo already had his bow in one hand and his money pouch in the other.

At that moment the hwarang became a whirlwind of movements, as he knocked the bows out of the bowmen’s hands with his scabbard. He rolled back, stretched his arm theatrically and caught the falling sword. With a lightning fast movement, he pressed his blade against the bandit’s throat, trimming a few inches off his beard.

The hwarang stood up, readied a third arrow, and held it just a few inches from the paralyzed leader’s face.","\n","^\"This type of arrow is called ‘battering ram’\", said the hwarang. \"Its tip weighs about half a pound.

The spell held only for a few seconds but it was enough time for the hwarang. He disarmed the archers, grabbed his sword from the shocked leader’s hands, pulled it out of the scabbard and when the mist cleared, Gee Soo’s blade was pressed against the thief’s throat.","\n","^\"Magic!\"","\n","^\"Indeed!\" confirmed the hwarang.","\n",{"->":".^.^.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["\n",{"#":"9"},"^Gee Soo became a whirlwind of movements.

Gee Soo turned to face the leader and the two archers that he had knocked down but they had already got on their feet and run away. The hwarang collected his scattered coins from the ground and continued on his way.

The poor creature was darting left and right, trying to evade the volleys of pebbles but it could not run past the children as they had formed a half-circle around it. On top of that, they had somehow managed to tie its tail to one of its hind legs. The hwarang’s heart filled with righteous anger and he rushed towards the little sadists to bring justice on them.","\n","^\"Hey, you little brats! Stop this at once! Why are you torturing this animal?\"","\n","^The kids did not bother to answer and shot another volley of pebbles at the dog, which had given up attempting to escape and had coiled up in a ball, pressed against the rock.","\n","^\"Scram or I'll tear your ears off!\" Gee Soo barked.","\n","^In response, one stocky kid turned to him and tried to shoot him with his sling. The hwarang dodged the poorly aimed shot and jumped towards the rascals.

I'll find out who you are and see that you get what you deserve!\" Kim Gee Soo shouted as he reached the rock.","\n","^The dog had come to its senses and was watching its savior with a mix of wonder and gratitude.","\n","^\"Eiishhhh,\" the hwarang blurted one last curse and looked at the dog which whimpered pitifully and moved towards him. He knelled and untied its tail while the animal was licking his hand with gratitude.","\n","^\"OK, OK! You don't have to thank me! Go on now and stay away from kids! They only seem harmless.\"","\n","^He stood up and continued walking but after a few steps, he realized the dog was following him.","\n","^\"Oh, no! Come on now!

A thick mist had shrouded the rooftops of the village houses. The air was heavy with the scent of green tea and so humid that it seemed to stick to the hwarang’s hands and face. He looked at the twin hills standing like silent guardians. They were evenly terraced and sown with the aromatic bushy plants that were the villagers’ main source of income. The view of the green terraces disappearing in the milky veil of mist brought up a strange sense of mysticism and timelessness. It was as if the invisible hilltops marked the end of the world and the beginning of the infinite universe. The landscape was beautiful, yet foreboding. It was the point where the known met the unknown. The hwarang was struck by the view, seized by contrasting feelings of peace and uneasiness.","\n","^He heard footsteps and turned to see an old woman passing by.","\n","^\"Are you in peace?\" he greeted.","\n","^\"There is no longer peace in our village, young man!\" she replied while still walking. \"Ever since she began to enthrall our lads, there’s been no peace for us!

It was big, by the village’s standards, and its owner was obviously wealthy. There were signs of neglect but Gee Soo could tell that until recently that house had been properly taken care of. It was as if the housekeeper had recently got ill or retired. The neighboring houses were smaller; their doors and window shutters were all locked, so talking to the neighbors was not an option, the hwarang noted. He approached the door and knocked. (If the hwarang is accompanied by a dog: The dog started barking angrily as he was walking towards the house. When it realized that he wanted to go in, it ran off.) A large man answered the door; he was in his fifties, with silver hair and beard.","\n","^\"What do you want?\" he asked angrily.","\n","^\"Are you in peace?\" greeted the hwarang. \"I am hwarang Kim Gee Soo.\"","\n","^\"I'm Hyo Won Jin.

I believe you about what you said outside, I saw your credentials and I am grateful for the help you are offering, but let us be honest. As beautiful as my Sa Gwa is and as ill as her fate may be, that alone could not be the reason for you to be here.\"","\n","^The hwarang decided that the man deserved to know the truth.","\n","^\"Well, the truth is that a renowned magistrate’s son has heard about your daughter’s proverbial beauty and wants to marry her. However, rumors of her curse have also reached him, which is why he dares not declare his intentions until he is sure the curse has been lifted.\"","\n","^\"I see,\" Won Jin nodded and went silent.","\n","^It was getting near dinnertime and Won Jin asked the servants to bring some food and call his daughter downstairs. Not long after that, Hyo Sa Gwa shyly entered the room. For a minute Gee Soo forgot to breathe. The rumors about her beauty did her no justice. The maiden was enchanting. Not a flake of make-up spoiled her perfect face. She had lush small lips, deep black eyes, thin eyebrows that no calligrapher could draw and small, slightly snub nose.","\n","^She raised her gaze, glanced at the hwarang and lowered her eyes again.","\n","^\"Good evening! Are you in peace?\" she spoke with a soft, sensual voice, which did not suit her age but lit up the room.","\n","^\"Good... good evening! And you?\" he replied and almost blushed.","\n","^\"My dear, that's hwarang Kim Gee Soo. He's come all the way from the capital to help you.\"","\n","^\"Oh, father!

Excuse us, please! My daughter still blames me for her mother's death and claims I’m responsible for her curse!\"","\n","^The maiden gave Gee Soo a surreptitious look full of challenge. He stood up, drew his sword and said:","\n","^\"I, hwarang Kim Gee Soo, swear that for as long as I breathe, I'll try to find a way to save these people from the curse that has befallen them. Let this be my promise and challenge to the evil forces that have caused this!\"","\n","^After this theatrical display, Won Jin looked flabbergasted and the maiden said quietly with fear in her voice:","\n","^\"Be careful what you say, hwarang.

She attacked me and when he tried to stop her, she knocked him out with a vase over his head. I couldn't hurt my savior’s wife so I tried to explain that there was no reason for her jealousy. She wouldn't listen. She started beating me and she would've killed me if it weren’t for the other servants. That same night I mustered all my strength and summoned my mother. She's an old and powerful kumiho with nine tails. When she saw the state I was in, she was furious. Before taking me back home to heal my wounds, she cursed Won Jin's wife. They say she died a month later. While I was recuperating, I told my mother how I had ended up like that. That's how she learned about Sa Gwa. After being gone for about a week, my mother came back one day and told me she had killed Sa Gwa. She made me take her shape to steal the life source of her wooers.

Tell me, honest innkeeper, what is this curse that you speak of?\"","\n","^\"Sa Gwa’s curse is the source of all our troubles. She is the fairest of all maidens in the region – in the whole kingdom if you ask me. But she is as fair as she is ill-fated. She comes from a good family with bad karma. Her father is one of the biggest producers and traders of green tea in the area and her mother was smart, beautiful and modest. She died two years ago. Since then fate has turned ill for our village. Sa Gwa became sick from grief and didn't leave her home for a year. Then one day, she suddenly came back to life. Only, she was no longer the shy girl we all knew. She was a beautiful young woman that began to flirt innocently with the local men. A few went to ask for her hand but were found dead the next morning. One died from alcohol poisoning. Another drowned in the nearby lake. Some people even  blamed me for poisoning the poor boys – imagine that! Obviously, the maiden is cursed and the locals began to fear for their well-being. But instead of serving as a sign of warning, the rumors were like kimchi on a hot day for the young men in the region. A few outsiders came to ask her for hand, but were also found dead the next morning. One torn by wolves, another had jumped off a cliff, the third...","\n","^In the end, Hyo Won Jin – her father – found this unknown shaman, this old hag who now roams the village streets, scares the people and does some dark rituals in the maiden’s house.\" The man stopped to take a breath and gulped a cup of soju, \"This is what’s been bothering us, good sir!\"","\n","^While the two were speaking, the group of young men left the tavern and the drunkard fell asleep face down on the table.","\n","^\"Well, that was a nice chat indeed,\" said the innkeeper and started to get up.","\n","^\"One more thing, good innkeeper!

Can you read what's written here – on the hilt?\"","\n","^The hwarang's sword was a masterpiece of blacksmith work. It was custom-made for its owner’s weight, height, strengths and weaknesses. These type of swords had their bearer’s name on the hilt.","\n","^\"Uhm... K...I...M,\" the lad was having a hard time, \"G..N.., no, no… E. Yes! Kim Gee Soo!\" the man said victoriously. Immediately after that, he went pale as he realized what he had just read. Suddenly the young men dropped to their knees and started begging for forgiveness for their insolence.","\n","^\"Get up!\" snapped the hwarang. \"No harm will befall you if my presence here remains a secret.\"","\n","^He looked around but the innkeeper was in the back room and the lonesome drunkard was sleeping face down on the table.","\n","^\"Now sit down, have a drink and tell me what you know about these rumors.\"","\n","^\"The old men and women claim that Sa Gwa is to blame for the troubles in the village but that’s not true.

It’s all her fault!\"","\n","^\"No, it’s not!\" another one disagreed. \"It’s Sa Gwa! She brought this on herself!\"","\n","^\"Hold on! One at a time, and don't interrupt each other! Why did you say her father's responsible for the curse?\" asked Gee Soo.","\n","^\"You see, Mr. Won Jin is important around here, a rich man. His green tea production is booming. But after his wife died two years ago everything went wrong. Back then, Sa Gwa was still a girl and she fell ill with grief. Instead of trying to cheer her up, her father locked her in the house for a year, thinking this would cast away the demon of her illness. And exactly a year after that, Sa Gwa was healthy again, or so it seemed. She started to leave the house again. And what a beauty she had become! Upon seeing her, you would forget about your tasks and duties. If she smiled at you, you would be unable to move even if your life depended on it. You would just stand there and giggle until somebody gave you a slap to snap you out of it. So a month passed and the first courageous man asked for her hand. Nobody knows exactly what happened but the poor guy was found dead the next morning. One month later, another one tried his luck. He was found drowned in the nearby lake, eaten by the fish. It was clear that because he would not let her marry anybody, Mr. Won Jin had enraged the illness demon and the poor Sa Gwa had to suffer for it.\"","\n","^\"I see. And you? Why did you say Sa Gwa was to blame for this?\"","\n","^\"Well, everything my friend told you is true, except that after she recovered, Sa Gwa looked and also acted different. She became flirtatious, of course in a most innocent way, but by doing that, she enraged the illness demon. No self-respecting young woman should behave like that.\"","\n","^\"You say so just because she mocked your large nose!\" another one commented.","\n","^\"My nose is not large! It is expressive!\"","\n","^The others laughed.","\n","^\"All right, all right,\" the hwarang tried to remain serious. \"Now tell me who is that Gunn woman?\"","\n","^\"The old Gunn is this shaman that Hyo Won Jin brought from somewhere after two more men died. She is a horrifying woman, I tell you! Even the dogs run away from her! It was she who cursed Sa Gwa! She's in her house every day! Every day she makes the curse stronger, I tell you that,\" the young man paused to catch his breath. \"So that's all there is to know, honorable hwarang, or at least most of it.\"","\n","^\"I see.\"","\n","^The young men continued eating and drinking.","\n","^\"Thank you for your help, fellas.

The hwarang quickly looked around. The innkeeper was in the back room and the young men had left the tavern.

Gwisin, the man had said. Gwisin is an evil spirit. Could it be true? The man was probably just scared. This was nothing more than a creature from old wives’ tales, made up to scare naughty children. \"That poor soul,\" he thought again and left the empty tavern.

After asking several people and receiving only mumbled and confusing directions, he finally found the house of Mayor Kang Jae Hi. It was in the southern part of Yo Soo and one of the largest and most beautiful houses in the village. It was a yangban house – L-shaped, roofed with wood shingles, with a big garden, and surrounded by a tall fence. This type of houses were typical for this part of the kingdom but you would not normally see them in a village the size of Yo Soo. The hwarang entered through the gate and was met by a cold, polite servant.","\n","^\"How can I help you, honorable sir?\"","\n","^\"Good day. I am hwarang Kim Gee Soo and I would like to speak with Mayor Kang about a matter of utmost importance. I’m sent personally by one of the king’s advisors.\"","\n","^\"I see, sir! I will inform the mayor immediately. Please follow me!\"","\n","^The servant led him to a fancy pavilion in the middle of the garden and asked him to wait. After some time he reappeared, bowed and said, \"Mayor Kang would like to see your credentials.\"","\n","^\"Excuse me?!\"","\n","^\"Mayor Kang would like to see your credentials,\" repeated the servant with the same disengaged tone.","\n","^The hwarang found this very insulting. He kept his anger in check and handed the document with a deadpan face. The servant took it, his hands trembling as he could sense Gee Soo’s anxiety. It was not long before the servant returned and said with shaky voice:","\n","^\"The mayor will see you now, hwarang.\"","\n","^Gee Soo said nothing. With the same stone-cold face, he stood up and followed the servant. They entered the house and the man knocked timidly on a beautifully ornamented door.","\n","^\"Yes?\" a voice asked from behind the door.","\n","^\"Hwarang Kim Gee Soo is here, mayor!\" said the servant with fear in his voice.","\n","^\"Let him in!\" commanded the voice.","\n","^Gee Soo entered a parlor where a writing table and two chairs were the only pieces of furniture.","\n","^\"Please, sit down!\"","\n","^The hwarang chose not to. He thought the mayor looked strangely familiar. Kang Jae Hi was still reading Gee Soo’s document, which was essentially an order for cooperation. Finally, he lifted his head, sighed without even attempting to hide his boredom, and asked:","\n","^\"How could I help you, hwarang?\"","\n","^With ill-hidden disdain, the warrior answered:","\n","^\"If it’s not too much trouble, could you spare some of your precious time and brief me on the recent events in Yo Soo…\" he paused and added, \"…honorable mayor?\"","\n","^\"There have been no events out of the ordinary,\" replied the mayor. \"Nothing that would request the attention of the highly respected magistrate, or a hwarang of your status. Nothing we can’t handle, at least.\"","\n","^\"Would you be more specific about this ‘nothing’? I heard that there was another death yesterday. That makes six this year. Perhaps I could help with dealing with that 'nothing', as you called it. That way you could direct your attention to more important matters, like this year’s tea harvest. The magistrate hopes that if the case is quickly solved, your production won’t drop yet again this year.\"","\n","^\"Why the sudden interest in Yo Soo’s green tea production?\" asked the mayor. \"If I’m not mistaken, we make less than one percent of the country’s total production.\"","\n","^\"Why the sudden doubt in decisions made by the higher authority?\" said Gee Soo with a fake polite tone. \"Especially from the mayor of a village the size of Yo Soo.\"","\n","^Mayor Kang’s efforts to bite his tongue were visible.","\n","^\"What would you like to know?\"","\n","^\"Everything.\"","\n","^\"Very well. Hyo Won Jin – the ill-fated maiden’s father is a respected member of our community and he is the head of one of the wealthiest families here. As far as I know, he is a hardworking man of common sense, yet lately his actions have refuted the latter. It all started when his wife died two years ago. After her mother’s death, Hyo Sa Gwa became secluded and did not leave the house for a year. But when she finally did, she was completely changed. She began to provoke the interest of the young men here. She is truly very beautiful and several lads fell in her charm. One by one, they asked her hand from her father, and on the next day, they were found dead. One was poisoned after drinking too much soju; another had drowned in the nearby lake, again, after having too much alcohol. The flesh-eating fish had made his face unrecognizable. Our youth nowadays are so empty-headed. The locals being superstitious, rumors of curses and evil spirits began to spread. They are simple village people – one can’t blame them for their fears. But the rumors spread outside our village and around the province. That’s when it all went out of control. Several young men from nearby towns and villages heard the stories of the enchanting maiden and tried their luck, ending up dead. I think they were killed by local jealous wooers, but I haven’t gathered the needed proof yet.","\n","^In the end, the whole story escalated to a point where even the respectable Hyo Won Jin sought help from some unknown shaman, that he found Buddha knows where. That hag now walks around the village, scaring people, and every day she performs strange rituals in Won Jin’s house,\" the mayor explained and paused to take a breath.","\n","^\"That’s all I know, honorable hwarang, and honestly, I don’t appreciate your presence here. The people are scared enough and my authority is questioned. I don’t have enough men to deal with riots. So, I wish you success in your task, for if you fail, I’ll be forced to call the king’s guard to quell the locals’ spirits.\"","\n","^\"I understand your fears, Mayor Kang, but be at ease – I will get to the bottom of this and my presence here will reassure the people. Thank you for your time. I’ll bother you no more,\" Gee Soo bowed and was ready to leave when the mayor suddenly asked:","\n","^\"How is your mother, hwarang Gee Soo?\"","\n","^Gee Soo froze mid-step.","\n","^\"She passed away a couple of years ago. Why do you ask?\"","\n","^\"I knew her, a long time ago when I was working at the capital. I am filled with sorrow to hear this sad news,\" the mayor said with an even tone.","\n","^\"I appreciate your condolences,\" said the hwarang coldly. He realized why Mayor Kang looked so familiar to him. Years ago, Mayor Kang was Magistrate Kang, who by the queen’s orders had made false accusations against his mother. The king himself interfered and expelled Kang from the court, giving him a small administrative job in the countryside. Apparently, as a mayor of Yo Soo.","\n","^\"I am glad to see that you and she have put your grudge behind you,\" said Gee Soo. \"Now she can rest in peace. I see that you have repented for what you did, since you accepted me so openly and gave me such detailed information.\" Every word was like a slap in Kang’s face, \"You can be sure that the capital will hear about your cooperation.\"","\n","^\"Thank you, hwarang,\" replied Kang with hatred in his voice. \"Is there anything else I can do for you?\"","\n","thread",{"->":"investigation_choices"},"ev","str","^<","ev",{"VAR?":"control"},{"f()":"HasAbility"},"out","/ev","^>If the hwarang has the ability Self-control and you want him to use it.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"control"},"/ev",{"->t->":"AdjustKiEnergy"},{"->":"question"},"done",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"local_shaman":[[{"#":"54"},"^Kim Gee Soo decided to look for the local shaman – the wise Che. A surprisingly not-too-unfriendly villager directed him to her house. It was at the end of the village. The man said that he could not miss it, and that his nose would lead his feet. When Gee Soo neared the hut, he found the directions to be true – there was a distinct smell that could not be mistaken. The hut itself did not look bad but it was surrounded by a mess comprising all sorts of tools and contraptions that formed something like a fence around it. Rising next to it was the shaman's tree – adorned with rags and totems – the shaman’s source of power. Behind the hut there was a small but surprisingly well-kept vegetable garden and a few fruit trees. There were no animals, as shamans do not eat meat, milk or eggs. Gee Soo approached and knocked politely on the door. He waited for a few minutes then knocked again.","\n","^After the third attempt, the hwarang decided that the wise Che was either not at home, or completely deaf. After a short consideration, he pushed open the unlocked door. Gee Soo entered and froze to the spot.","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"codewords"},{"VAR?":"shaman"},"?","/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n",{"->":".^.^.^.^.dead_shaman"},{"->":".^.^.^.11"},null]}],"nop","\n",{"#":"56"},"^The wise Che, a large woman, was bent over a boiling pot, with her glorious backside facing the door.","\n","^\"Would you close the door already?\" Her deep voice brought the hwarang out of his stupor and he closed the door. She was still bent over the pot and he began wondering how to avoid the view.","\n","^\"Sit down. I've been waiting for you all day,\" Che said, and he did as bid.","\n","^\"Young man, didn't your mother tell you it's not polite to stare?\" snapped the shaman, rising suddenly.","\n","^Though she was large and quite old, signs of her long past beauty were still visible.","\n","^One thing astonished him – her eyes were milky.","\n","^\"My apologies, madam!\"","\n","^\"It’s OK, my boy! Your mother didn’t tell you that women don’t always dislike being stared at. I'm glad that at my age I still catch young men's eyes!\" laughed the woman.","\n","^\"I agree, madam! It's quite hard for you to remain unseen,\" the hwarang tried to end the embarrassing conversation.","\n","^\"Aiigooo! Aren’t you a gentleman? You're so sweet when you’re blushing!\"","\n","^\"How did you...\"","\n","^\"How did I see you're blushing? I saw you but not with my eyes. I am a shaman, remember?\"","\n","^\"No, no! I just...\" he coughed, embarrassed.","\n","^\"Do you have a cold? Want some tea?\"","\n","^\"No, no! Look, honorable madam Che...\"","\n","^\"How do you know I'm a madam? You insult me for the second time today. Is this how you treat the people you want to ask for help?\"","\n","^\"Forgive me, Miss Che!\"","\n","^\"Good. And just ‘Che’ is even better.\"","\n","^\"Look, miss... wise Che, I'm here...\"","\n","^\"Like I said, dear boy, I know why you're here! You've come to ask for Hyo Sa Gwa – the cursed maiden – and how to lift the curse. Am I right?\"","\n","^\"Correct.\"","\n","^\"Good. Now listen and don't interrupt me. Hyo Won Jin – the girl's father invited evil in his house. It began three years ago, when he brought a young woman he had saved on his way back from a business trip and made her his servant. His wife loved him dearly but became jealous of the servant. Until one day, they say she caught her husband and the young woman in the act. She almost beat the servant to death. Some claim Won Jin’s wife poisoned her that same evening but I don’t think so. The servant just disappeared. One month later, Mrs. Hyo fell ill and died soon after that. She waned in front of my eyes and I couldn't even ease her pain, let alone cure her. Hyo was devastated but the horror didn't end there. After her mother died, Sa Gwa also fell ill with grief. She stopped eating and talking; she stopped living – she simply existed. It was as if her soul had left with her mother and nothing could bring it back. I tried everything to help the poor child, fought for months, but failed. Something was sucking the life out of her. Until one day, she was suddenly all right. She began to eat and speak again. But that wasn't the old Sa Gwa anymore. It was something else. Something horrible.\" The old shaman shivered.","\n","^\"I tried to tell her father but he wouldn't listen. He kicked me out and told me to stay away from his daughter. The thing inside Sa Gwa began to change her body to its liking. She gradually became the most beautiful young woman in the village and in the area. She began to charm the boys like an experienced kisaeng. Soon, a young man asked to marry her. He was found dead the next morning, his tongue black as if he had been poisoned. I'll never forget his death gaze – overjoyed as if in his death he had felt unearthly pleasure. The mayor announced that the man had died of alcohol poisoning. Most people believed him, but not me. Something had killed him. It had sucked his soul out of him and made him think this was the most pleasurable thing in the world. The next young man was found torn to pieces in the nearby lake. It was the fish, they said.","\n","^Nonsense! No fish eats only the liver and leaves everything else untouched. Something had killed him – the same thing that had killed the first man. Then Hyo brought to the village this creature pretending to be a shaman – the old Gunn. I tell you, Gunn is not human, my boy! Stay away from her! She's evil! Evil in human form! The thing that possessed Sa Gwa is still gathering strength, so maybe you still stand a chance to defeat it. I don't know what it is. I can only hope that an able young man like you could destroy it and, if possible, free the poor child trapped in her own body.\"","\n","^Gee Soo was silent, the hair on the back of his neck standing up.","\n","^\"I can't help you with much, but I could...\"","\n","ev","str","^<","ev",{"VAR?":"knowledge"},3,">=","out","/ev","^>If the hwarang has 3 or more Knowledge points.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^<","ev",{"VAR?":"mastery_ability"},{"VAR?":"shamanism"},"?",{"VAR?":"legendary_ability"},{"VAR?":"shamanism"},"?","||","out","/ev","^>If the hwarang has the ability Shamanism (at least at Master level).","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^<","ev",{"VAR?":"mastery_ability"},{"VAR?":"charisma"},"?",{"VAR?":"legendary_ability"},{"VAR?":"charisma"},"?","||","out","/ev","^>Or if the hwarang has the ability Charisma (at least at Master level).","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":4},"ev","str","^Otherwise.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-3","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":".^.^.^.teach_spell"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"shamanism"},"/ev",{"->t->":"AdjustKiEnergy"},{"->":".^.^.^.teach_spell"},{"#f":5}],"c-2":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"charisma"},"/ev",{"->t->":"AdjustKiEnergy"},{"->":".^.^.^.teach_spell"},{"#f":5}],"c-3":["\n",{"->":".^.^.^.give_potion"},"end",{"#f":5}]}],{"teach_spell":[[{"#":"57"},"^\"... teach you a simple spell, for you have the gift to cast it.
